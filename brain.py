""" Configurable brain assembly model for simulations and research.
Author: Daniel Mitropolsky, 2018

This module contains classes to represent different elements of a brain simulation:
    - Area - Represents an individual area of the brain, with the relevant parameters.
    - Connectomes are the connections between neurons. They have weights, which are initialized randomly but
        due to plasticity they can updated every time some neuron fires. These weights are represented by numpy arrays.
        The ones that are not random, because they were influenced by previous projections, are referred to as the 'support'.
    - Winners in a given 'round' are the specific neurons that fired in that round.
        In any specific area, these will be the 'k' neurons with the highest value flown into them.
        These are also the only neurons whose connectome weights get updated.
    - Stimulus - Represents a random stimulus that can be applied to any part of the brain.
        When a stimulus is created it is initialized randomly, but when applied multiple times this will change.
        This is equivalent to k neurons from an unknown part of the brain firing and their (initially, random)
        connectomes decide how this stimulus affects a given area of the brain.
    - Brain - A class representing a simulated brain, with it's different areas, stimulus, and all the connectome weights.
        A brain is initialized as a random graph, and it is maintained in a 'sparse' representation,
        meaning that all neurons that have their original, random connectome weights (0 or 1) are not saved explicitly.
    - Assembly - TODO define and express in code

    The list of neurons that are firing is given by 'winners'. It is updated through application of 'Brain.project',
    where the set of '_new_winners' is calculated and only updated once all brain areas settle on their new winners.
    The winners are the 'k' neurons with the highest value going in each round.

    Initially, most computation are represented implicitly. Winners are represented explicitly, and the changes in
    their incoming synapses are maintained in 'Brain.connectomes' and 'Brain.stimuli_connectomes'. The explicit neurons
    are represented by indices starting with 0 up to 'support_size'-1.

    Since it is initialized randomly, all the programmer needs to provide for initialization is the number 'n' of neurons,
    number 'k' of winners in any given round (meaning the k neurons with heights values will fire),
    and the parameter 'beta' of plasticity controlling connectome weight updates.
